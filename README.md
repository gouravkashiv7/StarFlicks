The Starflicks App is a movie search and rating platform built with React that utilizes the OMDb API for data.

Core Functionality and React Concepts

The website's operation is defined by the following React hooks and principles:

    useEffect for Data Fetching and Side Effects:

        The useEffect hook is the core mechanism for data fetching, executing an asynchronous request to the OMDb API (Open Movie Database) to get movie information.

        This effect is typically run when the component mounts (using an empty dependency array []) to load initial data, and again when the search term changes (including the search term in the dependency array) to fetch new results.

        It handles the side effect of fetching external data and updating the component's state with the results (movies list).

    OMDb API Integration:

        The OMDb API serves as the external data source. The application sends a search query to this API, which returns a list of movies matching the search term, including details like title, year, poster image, and potentially ratings.

    useState for State Management:

        State variables are used to manage the application's dynamic data, such as:

            The list of movie results to be displayed.

            The current search term entered by the user.

            The user's movie ratings or favorite selections (often stored in local storage).

            Loading or error states during the API call.

    Displaying Results and Rating:

        The fetched movie data is mapped over to render a list of Movie Card components.

        Users can search for movies and see the results displayed on the screen.

        A key feature is the ability to rate movies, which would involve components that capture user input (e.g., a star rating component) and update a local state or storage mechanism.

    useRef for Non-Reactive Values (Potential Use):

        The useRef hook is less directly involved in the main data flow but is typically used for things that don't need to trigger a re-render. Potential uses in a movie app include:

            Referencing a DOM element, like the search input field, to focus it programmatically.

            Storing a mutable value that changes without causing the component to re-render, such as a timer ID or a flag to prevent rapid, consecutive API calls (debouncing).

The application provides a straightforward user experience: search for a movie, view the data fetched from OMDb, and provide a personal rating.
